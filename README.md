# Project Aim
The aim of this project is to analyze and predict customer churn for a bank based on various customer related factors. By using analytic tools such as T-SQL and Power Bi, the project aims to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn, which can help banks in improving customer retention strategies and ultimately increasing profitability.

1. **What is the overall churn rate?**
2. **How does churn vary by country?**
3. **How does the number of products affect churn?**

5. **How does credit score influence churn?**
6. **Does tenure with the bank affect churn?**
7. **Does having a credit card impact churn?**
