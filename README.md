Key findings from the analysis highlighted specific areas that had high contributions to the high churn rates, such as customers who recently joined the bank as per tenure and customers with low credit scores.The analysis also revealed that majority of the customers had only 1 product which had significantly higher churn rates compared to customers with more that 1 product, further analysis reaveled that middle aged customers also churned more. Based on these insights the data team prescribed offering customers milestone rewards based on improving credit scores upon completion and introduce loyalty programs that reward long term usage with rewards and exclusive discounts.
